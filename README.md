# PowerFeather-Demo

This is an Arduino-based firmware that serves a web app for demonstrating the ESP32-S3 PowerFeather's power management and monitoring features.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required:

- ESPUI
- ESPAsyncWebServer
- PowerFeather-SDK

> [!TIP]
>  For the time being, it is also recommended to use the latest arduino-esp32 v2.x, due to some compatibility issues of ESPAsyncWebServer with v3.x.
